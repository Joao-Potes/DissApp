      <h1>About Student Assistant</h1>
      <h2>Empowering Your Coding Journey</h2>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        At Student Assistant, we're dedicated to transforming how new coders
        learn and interact with programming languages. Founded by a driven
        student at Solent University, our goal is to make coding more
        accessible, understandable, and engaging for everyone, especially
        beginners. Our platform is built on the belief that coding should not be
        intimidating, but a skill that is approachable and enjoyable to learn.
      </p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Learning to code can be daunting. Many students struggle with
        conventional one-size-fits-all courses that do not accommodate different
        learning speeds or styles. This gap can lead to frustration and
        demotivation, making it difficult for beginners to progress in learning
        this vital skill.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Student Assistant is set to launch in the near future with a suite of
        features designed to address these challenges:
